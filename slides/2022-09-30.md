\tableofcontents

#
\section{Plan}

# What you should have done by today

- Questions about Wireshark

    - Lab 1 test might include questions regarding Wireshark

- Questions about Python

    - Lab 1 test might include questions regarding Python3

- Questions about the assignment

    - Lab 1 test will include questions regarding the assignment and the libpcap

- A first draft of the assignment

# Next week?

- Upload your submission

    - Deadline is firm and non-negotiable

- Study for the exam

    - Assignment

    - Your code

    - libpcap

    - Wireshark

    - Python

- Watch all ARP content from the theory part of this course

#
\section{Testing}

# How do we test the first assignment?

Input checks:


- On interface

    - Correct value

    - no sudo / missing network interface

- On tracefile

    - Correct value

    - ~~Something that is not a tracefile~~

    - File does not exist (`os.path.exists`)

# How do we test the first assignment?

Input checks:

- nbytes
    - Values between 0 and 1514

    - Values above 1514

    - Values below 0


Warning:

Displaying weird exceptions or errors is unacceptable. Display a human-readable message.

# What about the traffic?

Network packets may also cause an undesired error in your program

- What happens when packet.len > packet.caplen

- And when packet.caplen < nbytes?


Be careful:

- Check that you capture **the whole packet**

- Only print bytes up to nbytes

# Print the packets

Wrong examples:

```
"\x11\x22\xaa\xbb\xcc"
```
```
0x11 0x22 0xaa 0xbb 0xcc
```
```
1122AABBCC
```
```
0b00001110110010
```
# Print the packets

Correct examples:

```
11 22 AA BB CC DD
```

```
11 22 aa bb cc dd
```
