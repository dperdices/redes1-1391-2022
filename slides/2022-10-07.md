\section{Test P1}

# How is the test?

Multiple-choice questions in moodle.

- Password will be provided. Wait for it.

- No materials can be used unless it is indicated

- You must obtain at least 50% correct answers

    - Incorrects answers do not substract

- **If you do not obtain 50\%, your grade for Lab 1 is 0.**

- We start at 11:10 (or later). You cannot leave the room once it has started.

\section{Intro to Lab 2}


# What is Lab 2 about?

In Lab 2, we are going to implement an ARP resolver with cache and ARP reply.

 - Implement Ethernet layer
    - Format

 - Implement ARP layer
    - Format
    - Order

# How to start?

0) Watch the ARP video (or pay attention to my explaination). Read the assignment.

1) Download the material for moodle

2) Read functions of ethernet.py

2.1) Which functions are already implemented?

2.2) Which functions should be implemented by you?

3) Read arp.py

3.1) How ethernet.py and arp.py interact?

3.2) Which functions are already implemented?

3.3) Which functions should be implemented by you?

# ARP request
Ethernet: 

- dstMAC: ?

- srcMAC: ?

- ethertype: ?

ARP:

- hwtype: ?          ptype: ?

- hwlen: ?           plen: ?

- opcode: ?

- s_hwaddr: ?        s_paddr: ?

- t_hwaddr: ?        t_paddr: ?

# ARP response
Ethernet: 

- dstMAC: ?

- srcMAC: ?

- ethertype: ?

ARP:

- hwtype: ?          ptype: ?

- hwlen: ?           plen: ?

- opcode: ?

- s_hwaddr: ?        s_paddr: ?

- t_hwaddr: ?        t_paddr: ?

# ARP grat. request
Ethernet: 

- dstMAC: ?

- srcMAC: ?

- ethertype: ?

ARP:

- hwtype: ?          ptype: ?

- hwlen: ?           plen: ?

- opcode: ?

- s_hwaddr: ?        s_paddr: ?

- t_hwaddr: ?        t_paddr: ?


#
\section{Self-assessment}

# What you should have done by today

- Read Assignment 2

    - What are you being asked for?

    - What is the material provided?

    - How are you going to be evaluated?

    - How do you know that what you are doing is right?

- Run program `practica2.py`

- First draft of ethernet.py

# What you should have done by next week

- An overview of arp.py

- A revised draft of ethernet.py

- Questions about the ARP implementation.

#
\section{Material}

# Repited code

Functions/classes are useful to avoid code repetition. If you do sth more than once, consider creating a function/class.

- Why? Because when you have a bug, you only have to fix it in one part of the code.

- Example

```
def createARPPacket(hwtype=0x0001, ptype=0x0800, 
                    hwsize=6, psize=4, #TODO
                    ):
    return bytes()
```


# Repited code

Another example

```
class ARPPacket():
    HWTYPE = 0x0001
    # TODO
    def __init__(self, hwtype=HWTYPE, #TODO
                ):
        self.hwtype = hwtype

    def to_bytes(self):
        return bytes()

    def from_bytes(data):
        return ARPPacket()

```
