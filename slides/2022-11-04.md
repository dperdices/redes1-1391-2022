\section{Lab 3}

# What is Lab 3 about?

In lab 3, we are going to cover the next levels of the network stack: L3 (network) and L4 (transport).

In particular:

\pause

- L3: IPv4

    - With fragmentation

    - With Options

\pause

- "L3.5": ICMP

    - Ping functionality (Echo req \& rep)

\pause

- L4: UDP

# L3: IPv4

It is important to understand the two main functionalities:

\pause

- Routing

\pause

- Forwarding

\pause

But what do we mean by routing and forwarding?

# Routing

**How do we go from $IP_A$ to $IP_B$?**

\pause

- The routing table is all you need!

\pause

```
$ ip route
```

```
default via 150.244.56.1 dev eth0 proto static 
150.244.56.0/22 dev eth0 proto kernel 
    scope link src 150.244.59.231 
192.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel 
    scope link src 192.17.0.1 linkdown 
192.18.0.0/16 dev br-992d119f2470 proto kernel 
    scope link src 192.18.0.1
```

# Forwarding

**Which interface?**

\pause

- For these labs, we only have one but normally is on the routing table.

\pause

**Which destination MAC address?**

\pause

- Well, do you remember a protocol to translate IP addresses to MAC addresses? :)
