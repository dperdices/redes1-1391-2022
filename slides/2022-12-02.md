# Testing your program:

Once you are done with coding, you must start testing your program as much as possible.

\pause
Do we know the expected behavior?

\pause
Do we know possible mistakes?

# UDP

When sending UDP datagrams,

\pause

- if the port is closed, ICMP response (Destination unreachable - Port unreachable) is sent.

\pause

- if we open the port using `nc -l -u <port>` (or `-p <port>`)

    - stdout of the nc process should receive exactly what we have sent.

    - How do we check two files are "equal"? `md5sum`
 

# ICMP

When sending ICMP ping requests (using our program or `ping`),

\pause

- if the program is running on the destination (h2),  
    - the program in h2 should print the fields of the request.

    - the program in h2 should answer.

\pause

- even if the program is not running.

    - the O.S. should also answer.

    - the sending host should receive the answers and print the RTT estimation.



# IP options

Repeat all tests with IP options.

- Is the IHL right? 

- The IHL is measured in 32-bits words. 

    - How do we handle header lengths that are not multiple of 4B?


# IP fragmentation

Repeat all tests with fragmentation (len(datafile) > MTU).

Behavior should be similar but...

- We do not process fragments, so our programs will not answer or process ICMP packets.

- O.S. does process fragments, so we will see answers in Wireshark

- UDP should work perfectly when using `nc`

#
\section{Self-assessment}

# What you should have done by today

- IP working

- IP options working

- UDP working

- ICMP done (testing needed)

# What you should have done by next week?

- End all coding

- Start testing the program

- Ask any question regarding the course

# And in two weeks?

- Submit everything

- Study for the test
